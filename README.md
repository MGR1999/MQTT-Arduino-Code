# MQTT-Arduino-Code

This code was originally created for the HyperRail project, as a part of the ECE Junior Design class at Oregon State University. This class ran from Fall 2020 to Winter 2021. This code was created for specific use on the ESP32 microcontroller, but any WiFi enable microcontroller that runs using the Arduino IDE should work. When running this code, the microcontroller acts as a publisher or subscriber on the network. No broker capabilities are included in the code, a public server is used as a broker for this MQTT setup. The MQTT enabled ESP32 was only a small part of the overall HyperRail system, for further information regarding our junior design project, please refer to the link below.
